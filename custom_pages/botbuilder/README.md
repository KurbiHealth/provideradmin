REPLICATING RAPPID (PAID) FUNCTIONALITY

These Rappid plugins are used in the demo
* joint.ui.Tooltip
* joint.ui.Halo
* joint.ui.TextEditor
* joint.ui.Dialog

We could recreate these tools (reverse-engineer rappid.min.js?), and plug them into the joint.ui namespace, as it exists in the open source joint.js file.
